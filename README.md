BBS Intro
=========

BBS intro written in 2000, pure x86 assembly (runs in DOSBox).
Good old times and useful experience (feeling like tired human C-compiler).

* Features horizontal blur and dynamic background with palette morphing.
* Uses sinetable fx from Radian 512b intro for ByteFall'99 by BSL/ZcS.
* Font.ttf is 752x16 TIF, bin2db.exe used for converting to font.inc.
